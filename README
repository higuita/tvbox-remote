TV Box remote

Decompiled and imported from http://kangasoft.com.sapo.pt/meo/meocomando1.3.zip
Sadly the site stop working long ago

Fixed missing close connection that made vodafone box crash with multiple commands
Renamed from MeoComand to tvbox-remote as this also works on vodafone box and probably several other cisco iptv boxes

TODO: 
- Allow switch between meo command image to vodafone image
- Really use the jar click.wav instead of the filesystem one
- Try to contact kangasoft and get a proper license

For now, AFAIK, copyright to Kangasoft
